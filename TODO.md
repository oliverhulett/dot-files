This is just a random assortment of TODO thoughts.  For more detailed TODOs, see the files in the `todo/` directory.

* Add README.md and CHANGELOG.md.
* Organise all the files better.
* Vim tip-of-the-day style thing.  Use the `<leader>/` `Cheat40` plugin to help me learn Vim.
    * Start with `Cheat40` open (but not focussed, change the focus/dismiss helper message at the top to indicate how to get rid of it when it's not focussed.).
    * Dynamically assign a random hint or tip to be shown at the top of the help window.
    * Add the shortcut (`<leader>/`) as a hint in the status bar.
* Where has my spelling highlighting gone in Vim?
* Vim: last command persists in the command line, can I make it decay or change colour or something when the command finishes?
* Vim: Sort out custom mappings.  Window navigation, quick-list and location-list usage and navigation, spelling and syntax error navigation...
* Vim: Markdown syntax nests lists by default, very annoying.
* Vim: Change auto-complete shortcut from `<C-P>` to `<leader><Tab>` or something easy like that.
* Vim: Flash new cursor position on jump.
* Vim: Highlight focussed window.
* General: Is it possible to have core files named to include their timestamp, rather than just process ID?
* TODO cmd to add to this ad-hoc todo list.
* Vim: Command/shortcut to add to help/`Cheat40` list.  Helps, prompts, or automates formatting and fields.
* less: Stay in less on short files, but also keep short files on screen after exit?  Do I still want that one?
* Colourise (pygmentise) `cat`, `head`, and `tail` output.  Need flag to disable?  detect output?
* Fix less at home, grr
* Fix less follow with `lessfilter` (or is it just `colourise.py`?)
* `stasher.py` force cache refresh with cmdline flag.  (Or are we happy to just find and remove temp file?)
* Git:  Organise wrapper better and test them
    * Instead of wrappers called from aliases, make them commands (`git-*` style) and wrap git to add them to the path.
    * Group things better:  branch management, externals management, resolution helpers, cleaning, pulling, refs and discovery?
