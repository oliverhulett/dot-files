I want to sync (only some) files from dot-files at work to dot-files at home.
Can't be completely automatic (at the moment) because things are differently pathed and the requirements are not identical.
 - Can I fix that pathing?  export DOTFILES= or something?
 - How about using BASH_ENV to load ~/.bash_aliases/*-profile.d-*
   - Could export DOTFILES there (and others as needed)
   - Will ~/.bashrc still be loaded for shells?

Windoze/sync2home now exists.  Run from my Optiver windows machine it'll create patches for dot-files and bin for all changes since last time it was run and zip and e-mail them.
I've hooked it into the vagrant restart.bat
